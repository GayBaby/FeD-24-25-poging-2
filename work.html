            <h2>Cobot, defining the future of robot interaction</h2>
            <p>Cobot was founded in 2022 by former Amazon VP of Robotics Brad Porter, with a team of robotics and AI experts from Amazon, Apple, Meta, Google, Microsoft, NASA, and more. Prior to raising a $30M Series A, we were tasked with designing their brand system, visual identity, and launch website. They’ve since gone on to raise a further $100M Series B, and are well on their way to unicorn status.</p>

            <h2>A system that embodies Cobot's core values</h2>
            <p>Cobot needed a brand system that embodies their core tenets: Trustworthy, Adaptable, and Useful. Our objective was to create a cohesive visual identity that aligns with these principles and their core values which are Listen, Trust, Contribute, Empower, and Reflect. We developed a modern logo that symbolises the synergy and trust between humans and robots, alongside vibrant, dynamic colours balanced with neutral tones, that convey adaptability and trustworthiness.</p>

            <h2>The interaction between human and robot</h2>
            <p>We wanted to strike a balance between a professional and friendly style, to reflect both the human-robot collaboration and the professional environments in which the cobots operate, such as healthcare, warehouses, and offices. Within the brand system we included high-quality images showcasing real-world applications, emphasising utility and interaction, and introduced clean, sans-serif fonts for readability and a contemporary feel. We explored using expressions based on the Cobot logo to create a friendly and more approachable feel.</p>

            <h2>Developing a memorable brand presence</h2>
            <p>With a combination of precise and minimal design, we wanted to capture the essence of advanced technology and forward-thinking, while implementing a unified visual language that will work flexibly across all platforms. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of the robotics industry and market trends, and closely collaborated with Cobot with multiple rounds of refinement to incorporate feedback and ensure alignment with their core values.</p>

            <h2>Successful launch yields positive outcomes</h2>
            <p>The new brand system was rolled out across Cobots' marketing materials, and product packaging while the website we built went live in time for their Series A funding announcement that had to accurately coincide with media coverage. We helped to increase brand recognition and enhance visibility within the industry, while helping to create a modern, professional image reinforcing their leadership in robotics innovation. Stakeholders and audiences responded positively, noting the alignment with the company’s vision and core values.</p>
